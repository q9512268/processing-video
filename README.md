Processing Video
================

Repository of the video library for Processing. 

This library comprises classes for movie playback and video capture. It is based on the [gstreamer multimedia framework](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/), and uses the [gst1-java-core](https://github.com/gstreamer-java/gst1-java-core) bindings to interface gstreamer from Java.

The version in master currently uses GStreamer 1.x, thanks to the amazing work by [Gottfried Haider](https://github.com/gohai)

Please submit all your bug reports and pull requests related to the video library here. Your contribution is really important to keep the Processing project moving forward!
